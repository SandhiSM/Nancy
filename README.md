# Nancy

## description

This application Nancy converts any number from binary to 36 decimal to any number from binary to 36 decimal.
However, Nancy may introduce errors when converting decimals.
If Nancy detects that error, a warning will be displayed.
Enter 'y' if you accept the error, otherwise enter 'n'.
If there is an error, please send an email to the following email address along with all the arguments you have entered.
(By the way, 'Nancy' is the acronym for 'n-ary-number-converter', which is 'nanc', but it was kind of hard to call, so I added a 'y'.)

## usage

``` commandline
nancy.exe <number> <from> <to>
```
